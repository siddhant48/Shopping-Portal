I, Siddhant Chourasia developed this project as part of learning web development. To run this project -use XAMPP -copy and paste all files in c://xampp//htdocs -start apache and MySQL in xampp control panel -open any browser
Now open phpmyadmin by typing the url in your browser with localhost/phpmyadmin and create a new database with name mm-ecom and import file in this database from a database folder. 
Now you are all set -To run this web application type "http://localhost/mm-ecom/" in url section of browser . This will bring you to the homepage of application.
